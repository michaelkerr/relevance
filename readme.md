Relevance

Relevance machine learning algorithm for determining topic relevance of social media content (forums and tweets, but applicable to any social network).

Current state
Very specific to a current implementation, need to generalize it.  Arabic and Indonesion stop words only, but an easy addition.  Current model creation is SLOW for Forums, and there is a significant amount of noise - this also causes problems with accuracy of the relevance output, though it remains high.
